ERSS Homework4 Scalability

Server code must run on 4-core vcm
To run the server code:
sudo docker-compose up

You may alter the server-side threading strategy
and the number of active cores by modifying the last line in src/run.sh:
The argument after "taskset --cpu-list" indicates which cores to use
The argument after "./server" indicates the threading strategy

Examples:
taskset --cpu-list 0 ./server 0 -> 1 core active, create a thread per request
taskset --cpu-list 0-1 ./server 0 -> 2 cores active, create a thread per request
taskset --cpu-list 0-1 ./server 1 -> 2 cores active, pre-create a set of threads
taskset --cpu-list 0-3 ./server 1 -> 4 cores active, pre-create a set of threads



Client code must be run after server code in another vcm

To the client code (tesing infrastructure) :
cd testing
./client hostname delay_lower delay_upper bucket_size num_of_threads

You may try the following commands in the testing directory:
./client vcm-xxxxx.vm.duke.edu 1 3 32 1000
./client vcm-xxxxx.vm.duke.edu 1 3 512 1000
./client vcm-xxxxx.vm.duke.edu 1 20 32 1000
( vcm-xxxxx.vm.duke.edu is the 4-core vcm)
