To run the server code:
sudo docker-compose up

You may alter the server-side threading strategy by modifying the last line in src/run.sh
The argument after ./server indicates the threading strategy:
create a thread per request -> 0
precreate a set of threads -> 1

You may also alter the number of active cores by modifyting the last line in src/Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["taskset --cpu-list 0 ./run.sh"] -> 1 core active
ENTRYPOINT ["taskset --cpu-list 0-1 ./run.sh"] -> 2 cores active
ENTRYPOINT ["taskset --cpu-list 0-3 ./run.sh"] -> 4 cores active



Client code must be run after server code

To the client code (tesing infrastructure) :
cd testing
./client hostname delay_lower delay_upper bucket_size num_of_threads

You may try the following commands in the testing directory:
./client vcm-xxxxx.vm.duke.edu 1 3 32 1000
./client vcm-xxxxx.vm.duke.edu 1 3 512 1000
./client vcm-xxxxx.vm.duke.edu 1 20 32 1000
